Simple reddit clone

I build this simple appliction from Ng-book.

1. Split your app into components
2. Create the views
3. Define models
4. Display models
5. Add interaction with user

I like how the Model-View-Controller displayed in this chapter. I also deploy my app with Versel and it's pretty easy to use
